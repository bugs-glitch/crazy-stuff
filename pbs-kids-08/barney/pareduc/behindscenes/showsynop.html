            Barney's friends are racing to clean up the park, but Kami has trouble 
            keeping up with the other kids - even when they pretend to be ants 
            marching in a parade! Barney and Scott visit the Idea Bench where 
            Scott comes up with a great idea - to show Kami that even though the 
            caboose is the last car in the train, it's the most important because 
            that's where the conductor rides. With Kami playing &quot;Conductor 
            for the Day,&quot; they learn all about trains and have fun checking 
            out a model train. Then, they work together to clean up the old caboose 
            in the park as they sing &quot;I've Been Working On the Railroad.&quot; 
            When Barney tells them how railroad signal flags are used, the children 
            make their own flags and wave them around the park. Barney's friends 
            learn that from the first to the last in line, everyone is special.

            Tony wants to show off his handmade kite - but it doesn't have a string, 
            so the kite isn't ready to fly. When an unexpected breeze blows it 
            high in the treetops, Barney and the kids discuss the ups and downs 
            of getting the kite out of the tree. The kids discover more about 
            what's up and what's down in the world all around them as they sing 
            &quot;Up Is Up and Down Is Down.&quot; Playing fun games like London 
            Bridge and I Spy also helps the kids discover more about up, down 
            and all around. Finally, with a great idea from Tony and a little 
            inspiration from Baby Bop, the &quot;The Baby Bop Hop&quot; brings 
            the kite tumbling down from the treetop. Every day can have its ups 
            and downs, but thanks to Barney and his friends, every day can be 
            all around fun for everyone! <br>

            two special guests - Baby Bop and BJ! When they find the decorations 
            they need in the caboose, the flowers make Baby Bop sneeze, and they 
            all sing &quot;Keep Your Sneeze To Yourself&quot; so Baby Bop can

            and &quot;Thank You&quot; are the correct words to use when asking 
            for more cookies. And singing &quot;Clean Up! Do Our Share&quot; makes 
            cleaning up good manners and good, clean fun. Barney puts on a humorous 
            presentation about bad manners with a story about some messy kids 
            named &quot;The Floodledoops.&quot; The silliness continues as they 
            sing &quot;Silly Sounds.&quot; Reminding his friends about good manners

            parade, and they begin by making license plates. When Nick's bike 
            is fixed and Barney adds the finishing touch with balloons - the parade 
            is ready to roll! <br>

            It's an extra special day when Beth invents a new holiday called &quot;Happy 
            Day.&quot; The kids can make a wish for something that will make them 
            happy - and the others try to make the wish come true. Barney and 
            the kids discuss faces and feelings and the ways people show they're 
            happy - by laughing or hugging. Dogs wag their tails, and cats show 
            they're happy when they purr, which leads to singing &quot;Three Little 
            Kittens.&quot; When the kids pretend to be robots, they discover that 
            sad feelings are better than no feelings at all. BJ's wish to take 
            a fishing trip changes when Beth has an unexpected accident that makes 
            her &quot;Happy Day&quot; a sad one. When BJ throws a surprise party 
            for Beth, everyone is happy. Barney reminds the kids that the best 
            happiness of all is doing things for others. <br>

            Nick, Whitney and Gianna are invited to a picnic, but they don't know 
            who invited them. They're instructed to bring a family treasure, so 
            Nick shows them a toy truck that belonged to his father. Whitney's 
            treasure is a bracelet her grandmother gave her, and Gianna's treasures 
            are teddy bears - which leads to singing &quot;Teddy Bear Picnic.&quot; 
            Mario's family treasure is a book given to him by his brother. As 
            the children discuss types of families, they learn that families might 
            even include pet dogs! Barney explains that no matter the size, families 
            are people who love one another. Arriving at the picnic, they discover 
            that Barney sent their invitations and that he has a special surprise; 
            it's a family picnic, and their families were invited too! When asked 
            why his family didn't come, Barney responds that his friends are his 
            family. <br>

            A &quot;too hot&quot; afternoon becomes a &quot;totally cool&quot; 
            day when Barney introduces his friends to the wonderful world of water. 
            A cool drink at a water fountain leads to a discussion that water 
            is everywhere around them. Water is important for drinking and bathing, 
            and it's fun for playing in - as Captain BJ proves with the help of 
            his toy boat. Droopy flowers in the park get water from the kids, 
            and hot kids get nice cool lemonade from Angela. As they listen to 
            the watery sounds of an aquarium, they sing &quot;The Fishing Song&quot; 
            and &quot;If I Lived Under the Sea.&quot; The ultimate way to experience 
            water is to get into the swim of things with a real swimming pool 
            - which makes a big splash with the kids and is a good opportunity 
            to review swimming safety rules. Water is everywhere, and fun is anywhere 
            with Barney! <br>

          <a name="720"></a><b>PBS #720 BJ's Really Cool House</b><br>
            The park is a home away from home for Barney and his friends, but 
            BJ wants to build his very own &quot;totally awesome, completely cool&quot; 
            house. While BJ works on his house, Barney teaches the kids about 
            houses and homes through songs such as &quot;That's A Home To Me&quot; 
            and by using his laptop computer to show them a variety of homes from 
            around the world. Following is an impromptu show about fanciful nursery 
            rhyme homes. When a picture puzzle of rooms in a house triggers a 
            series of make-believe activities, a toy kitchen yields yummy macaroni 
            and cheese, and a bubbling bathtub is the right place for Baby Bop's 
            bath. BJ thinks his house is finished but discovers he's forgotten 
            something and needs to make room for someone he loves - Baby Bop! 
            Barney reminds them that a family and loving friends make a house 
            a home. <br>
