            Educational Approach Of <em>Barney &amp; Friends</em>&#8482; </strong>

            </font>Educational by Design</strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The series <i>Barney &amp; 
            Friends</i> is a unique blending of education and entertainment for 
            preschool children. By design, the television series addresses the 
            four key areas of childhood development - cognitive, social, emotional, 
            and physical.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of these areas is 
            carefully researched by a team of early childhood specialists, with 
            special attention devoted to the unique learning styles of young children. 
            &quot;Each Barney episode emphasizes language and cognitive development, 
            physical activity and social interaction,&quot; says Vice-President 
            of Content Development, Mary Ann Dudko, Ph.D. &quot;Interesting, meaningful 
            and relevant topics are selected to present educational concepts appropriate 
            for, and eagerly embraced by, the target group of children ages two 
            to five,&quot; she adds.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In each episode, 
            young viewers are invited to use their imaginations in problem-solving 
            situations. I have found that the best way to help children become 
            problem-solvers is to develop their creativity and their imaginations; 
            the two are tied very closely. Young viewers are encouraged to get 
            up and move around as the cast members sing and dance,&quot; Dr. Dudko 
            adds, &quot;The songs and choreography are presented in a simple, 
            repetitive style - a key to successful learning for young children.&quot; 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Researchers at 
            Yale Commend <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i></strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The value of <i>Barney 
            &amp; Friends</i>' educational influence on children has been well 
            documented. Yale University's Family Television Research &amp; Consultation 
            Center produced a series of studies on <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i>, 
            concluding that the show has a very positive educational impact on 
            young children. The show particularly influences language development, 
            one of the early indicators of future success in school, according 
            to the Yale researchers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their first study, Drs. 
            Jerome and Dorothy Singer of the Yale Center reported that <i>Barney 
            &amp; Friends</i> was &quot;nearly a model of what a preschool program 
            should be.&quot; Later studies indicated that <i>Barney &amp; Friends'</i> 
            positive influence extends to children of culturally diverse and low-income 
            groups. Teachers who took part in the study reported that after viewing 
            <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i>, occurrences of violent and aggressive 
            play were reduced among preschool students. In a study by the Singers, 
            their research illustrates that <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i> helps 
            children be better prepared to enter a structured learning environment. 
            According to the study, episodes in this series were especially strong 
            in dealing with pro-social behaviors and with emotion. &quot;...<i>Barney 
            &amp; Friends</i> continues to be a television series that adds much 
            to our nation's goal to 'ready' children for school.&quot; (Singer 
            &amp; Singer, 1999)</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Integrating Educational 
            Concepts into <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i></strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Child development experts 
            guide the production process of <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i> from the 
            creation of story themes to script development, through pre-production 
            and production. An educational specialist is on the set during taping 
            to ensure that the production remains developmentally appropriate 
            for preschoolers. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The show features the beloved 
            Barney, his friend Baby Bop, her big brother, BJ, and a culturally 
            diverse cast of children who have fun learning about positive concepts 
            such as good health and safety habits, friendship, good manners, self-esteem, 
            and concern for others. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barney concludes each episode 
            of <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i> with a short talk directed to the viewer. 
            This &quot;Barney Says&quot; format summarizes and reinforces the 
            episode's events as well as the educational concepts presented.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<i>Barney &amp; Friends</i> 
            has been around for 10 years,&quot; says Dr. Dudko. &quot;The show 
            has been consistently educational, consistently genuine and I think 
            parents know that. I know children know it,&quot; she adds.</font></p>
