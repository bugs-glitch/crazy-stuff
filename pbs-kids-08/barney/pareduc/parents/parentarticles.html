          <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Play It Safe On Playgrounds 
            </font></b> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the warm weather 
            months, children head for the playground to climb the jungle gym, 
            jump rope and sway happily on swings. But with this fun also comes 
            an increased risk of injury for children. Each year, more than 220,000 
            children ages 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency rooms 
            for playground equipment-related injuries. Approximately 70 percent 
            of these injuries occur on public playgrounds. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;As parents and caregivers, we need to make sure that playgrounds 
            are safe for our children,&quot; said Heather Paul, Ph.D., executive 
            director of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. &quot;By taking a few 
            precautions, we can assure that our playgrounds will be places to 
            have fun - not places to get hurt.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Although playground designs are changing dramatically and often incorporate 
            safety-conscious features, a thorough check and modification of playgrounds, 
            especially older ones, could prevent serious injuries. <br>
            <br>
            To determine if your neighborhood or home playground is safe, the 
            National SAFE KIDS Campaign offers the following guidelines: <br>
            <br>
            <b>Check the Playground's Surface</b><br>
            Checking the surface under playground equipment is critical considering 
            that more than 90 percent of public playgrounds lack adequate protective 
            surfacing. While kids may still fall, a cushioned surface can significantly 
            help in reducing serious injuries. Asphalt or concrete are too dangerous 
            for children. Equipment placed on asphalt or concrete should be removed 
            and installed on a softer surface. Grass and soil, while better than 
            asphalt or concrete, can become compacted making them hard and dangerous 
            as well. <br>
            <br>
            If well maintained, 12 inches of shredded mulch, pea gravel, crushed 
            stone and other loose surfaces are safe; however, all of these types 
            of materials require replacement and continuous maintenance such as 
            leveling, grading, raking, and sifting in order to maintain their 
            cushioning ability. Though costly, rubber mats, synthetic turf and 
            other artificial materials also are safe surfaces and require less 
            maintenance. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Maintain Equipment Properly</b><br>
            Equipment should be mounted securely in level concrete footing below 
            surface level to prevent children from tripping. To maintain adequate 
            fall zones (the area under and around playground equipment where children 
            can land), equipment should be located at least six feet away from 
            fences, walls and other equipment. If many children use the playground, 
            extra space around equipment will ensure fewer injuries. The National 
            SAFE KIDS Campaign recommends you take the following steps to maintain 
            or create a safe playground. </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Install slip-resistant 
              surfaces on climbing and gripping parts of all playground equipment. 
              </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Install guardrails or 
              other protective barriers around elevated platforms. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paint or galvanize metal 
              equipment to prevent rusting, which can result in weakened structures 
              and sharp, broken edges. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remove potentially hazardous 
              parts, such as protruding bolts or sharp corners. These items can 
              cause strangulation, punctures or scrapes. Close all S-hooks completely. 
              </font></li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Watch for Moving Swings</b><br>
          Being struck by or jumping from swings is the cause of many injuries. 
          Lightweight rubber plastic seats are safer than heavier metal or wooden 
          ones. Only two swings should be allowed per bay; remove one or two swings 
          from a set to reduce crowding. Tire swings are a good alternative but 
          drainage holes should be drilled to keep water from collecting in the 
          bottom of the tire. A tire swing should not be hung in a bay with another 
          swing. <br>
          <br>
          Maintaining safe equipment is only part of playground safety. Adequate 
          supervision by adults is required at all times given that 40 percent 
          of all playground injuries are related to inadequate supervision. The 
          National SAFE KIDS Campaign recommends the following helpful rules to 
          teach children: </font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not run, push, shove 
              or fight while near or on equipment; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take turns if more than 
              one child wants to use a piece of equipment; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walk around moving swings, 
              not in front of them; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not swing empty seats 
              or twist swing chairs; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sit properly on equipment 
              and do not overcrowd; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Make sure your partner's 
              feet are on the ground before getting off a seesaw; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be careful when walking 
              near moving equipment; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not climb up slides, 
              use the ladder; </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask adults for help 
              if there is a problem on the playground, such as a fight or an injury; 
              and </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not wear clothing 
              with drawstrings, necklaces, scarves or other items around the neckline 
              while using playground equipment. Such items present a strangulation 
              risk. </font></li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there is a problem with 
          poorly maintained playgrounds, parents should encourage a local parent/teacher 
          organization or community group to maintain neighborhood playgrounds 
          properly. The group can work with the local school board or city council 
          to commission a regular maintenance contract with a professional playground 
          equipment company. <br>
